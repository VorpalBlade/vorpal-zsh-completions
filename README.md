# Vorpal ZSH completions

Some ZSH completions I wrote and where the upstream project appears dead. All
of these have been submitted to the respective upstream project but nothing has
happened.

When/if completions are merged upstream and a new release is made, the files will
be removed from this repository.

## Installation

This is an oh-my-zsh style plugin and is compatible with any plugin manager
that supports that format. Refer to the documentation of your zsh plugin
manager for specifics. Loading it this way is recommended.

Another option is to simply source `vorpal-zsh-completions.plugin.zsh` from
your `.zshrc`.
